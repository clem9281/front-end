Welcome to Bubl, helping elementary age students connect before entering middle school.

This project was built using create react app and LESS. Enter the bubl directory and run ### `yarn install` . Then, within bubl run ### `yarn start` to start your development server. It is recommended to use the yarn commands, rather than the npm commands listed in the create react app readme.

To run the less watch compiler, once you have run yarn install within the bubl directory, go into the src directory and run ### `less-watch-compiler less css index.less`. This will compile your LESS.

Don't forge to use ### `yarn run build` as your build command for deployment.

The bubl directory contains a \_redirects file within the public directory to handle routing problems with netlify.
